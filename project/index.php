                        <p>  I'm making virtual mouse and keyboard using camera as the input. The camera
                            detect the location of my hand and map it with the width and height of the monitor
                            then move the cursor to certain location, work the same with the keyboard. 
                            I'm satisfied with the result, although it's not perfect, and still open to further development.
                        </p>

                                Sometimes I try to make something in my spare time. Sometimes useful things and 
                                sometimes useless things. Although sometimes the things I make are not 
                                perfect but this can add to my experience of trial and error

                                <p>
                                    I try making an EMG-ECG module for a microcontroller like Arduino or ESP. 
                                    The module consists of instrument amplifier using AD620 IC and some basic 
                                    bandpass filters with an inverting amplifier using Op-amp IC. After some 
                                    adjustment in the gain, the module can detect muscle movement in the forearm
                                     flexor muscle and heartbeat, with only 3 connections to the microcontroller 
                                     (2 for the supply and 1 for the output).

                                    I'm making virtual mouse and keyboard using camera as the input. The camera
                                    detect the location of my hand and map it with the width and height of the monitor
                                    then move the cursor to certain location, work the same with the keyboard. 
                                    I'm satisfied with the result, although it's not perfect, and still open to further development.

                                    A tool for measuring a person's bioimpedance, using a microcontroller as a signal processor and 
                                    reader for measurement results, and displaying them. The tool made consists of a signal generator 
                                    which uses a Wien bridge oscillator circuit and AD9833 Module to produce a sine signal, 
                                    then VCCS to convert the voltage input into a current source so that it is safe when it enters the body, 
                                    then the signal read using an instrument amplifier as an amplifier for easy reading, and converted into a DC signal 
                                    to be read by the microcontroller. The results of the tool can read 
                                    the impedance value both on the resistor and on the human body.

                                    namely ESP32-S2 with MicroPython. This tool consists of a microcontroller which functions 
                                    to control the electrode output, regulate the signal frequency, and obtain data. 
                                    Then the data will be processed using the Python program with the PyEIT library to reconstruct the resulting data into a 2D image. 
                                    This EIT can be used on several types of electrodes with a maximum of 16 electrodes.

                                During my studies in Biomedical Engineering major at Airlangga University, 
                                I specialized in the Medical Instrumentation field and conducted 
                                a research thesis titled <b>"Design of Electrical Impedance Tomography 
                                (EIT) To Detect Breast Cancer Using Analog Discovery Module"</b>. 
                                This project involved both hardware and software. For the hardware consists of some 
                                basic circuitry including filter, multi/demultiplexer, vccs and instrument amplifier, and
                                for the controller using Analog Discovery 2. The software consists of Analog Discovery programing
                                (JavaScript) and EIDORS (Matlab) for the image reconstruction.
